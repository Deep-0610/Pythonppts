# TODO for Enhancing Stone Paper Scissors Game

- [x] Enhance UI: Add vibrant colors to buttons, labels, and background. Use color-coded results (green for win, red for loss, yellow for tie). Increase font sizes and add padding for better visuals.
- [x] Add addictive features: Implement "Best of 5" mode with round counter, streak tracking, and a win celebration message. Include a reset button to start over.
- [x] Improve backend: Introduce more randomness with a "power-up" feature (random chance for double points or auto-win). Add score persistence (save high score to a file).
- [x] Enhance algorithm unpredictability: Modify computer choice with weighted randomness based on user history (e.g., slightly favor countering user's most chosen move).
